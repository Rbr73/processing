
To create the documentation, type "bin/buildout" in the buildout directory on your branch. This will run a
Sphinx build that will generate a directory called "_build", which contains the html pages generated by
Sphinx. To display the documents, you must type "bin/docs."

NOTES: Any .dia files placed within the diagrams/ directory will be converted into .png files, resized, 
and placed in the generated_images folder.  .dia files should be version controlled.

Any "static" .png files (i.e., not generated) should placed within the appropriate images/"document"
sub-directories.  These static images should be version controlled.

Sphinx will take care of copying any of the images that are used in any of the documents to the
_build/html/_images directory.
